# Presence audiences and time-boxed shares (P§6, P§7): Bob grants Alice his `family` audience, and Carol a share of
# 25 s with no audience. His phone publishes two records, each signed by itself: `available` for everyone it shares
# with and `busy` for family (P§6). Alice, admitted by the family grant, sees busy; Carol sees only the record with no
# audience, available. When Carol's share reaches its valid_until the relay ends her watch (policy.terminated), and a
# renewal is refused. Self-verifying.
