# Sealed presence (P§12): Bob seals his presence, so his relay carries states it cannot read. The grants his phone
# issues carry the keys (sealed to the grantee, P§12.3); Alice and Carol open his records with them, while Dave, whose
# grant was issued without keys, sees his records but cannot read them (P§12.4). Bob's phone ends Alice's share: it
# revokes her grant at the relay, rotates `main` to epoch 1 and re-grants Carol with the new key (P§12.5). His laptop,
# watching its own identity, sees the phone's record at epoch 1 and seals there too. Carol reads both devices; Alice
# is refused. Self-verifying.
