# A second hello from a device the relay already binds replaces the prior connection (§13.2), and only that one: the
# relay closes the old connection and keeps the new one bound. Bob's phone binds, is frozen (so it cannot reconnect),
# and Bob's phone binds again from another process: the relay must close the first connection and leave the second
# bound, not drop both and unbind a device that is still connected. Then two live processes of one device: the relay
# tells the replaced one `transport.replaced` (spec-gap 158), and it stops instead of reconnecting, which would replace
# the other in turn. Self-verifying.
