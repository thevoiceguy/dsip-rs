//! `dsip-messenger` — a messaging device for native applications: the
//! [`dsip_messaging_device::messenger::Messenger`] (the [`Engine`], which decides everything the Messaging Profile asks
//! of a device) together with what a native host does around it: the `wss` connection to the device's mailbox and
//! its reconnects, requests that wait for their answers, KeyPackages fetched from other identities' mailboxes, blobs
//! fetched and retried, successor groups created when a hub is gone, and the state written after every step.
//!
//! The application implements [`Host`]: every [`Output`] reaches it in order, as it happens, with the engine to read
//! from. It drives the device with [`Messenger::recv`] (a frame from the mailbox, `None` while offline),
//! [`Messenger::on_frame`], [`Messenger::tick`] once a second, and [`Messenger::settle`] after anything that set
//! deposits going; it acts with the engine ([`Messenger::engine_mut`]) and sends what the engine returns
//! ([`Messenger::send_frames`]). dsip-msg is such a host.
//!
//! Spec: M§4.2 (the mailbox is found in the DID document), M§4.3 (bind with `hello`; rebinding re-sends what the
//! last binding took with it, M§9.3), M§5.4–M§5.5 (sync, KeyPackage fetch), M§7.5 and M§9.4 (successors of a group
//! whose hub is gone, retried with backoff), M§8.4 (blob fetch, verification, retries; spec-gap 106), §13.2
//! (reconnect with exponential backoff and full jitter: 1 s, ×2, 60 s).
//!
//! Impl: the state is written under the engine's keys (`messenger`, and `resume`, which the item transactions write
//! too, spec-gap 44) and one key of the host's ([`Config::host_key`]): the blob fetches still to retry, beside what
//! the host adds ([`Host::saved`]).
