//! The mailbox/hub service as a library: [`MailboxServer`]. The `dsip-mailbox` binary parses flags and hosts one; an
//! application embeds one the same way, over TLS ([`MailboxServer::serve_tls`]) or over any byte stream
//! ([`MailboxServer::accept`]).
//!
//! Spec: M§4.3 (bind with `hello`, advertise mailbox capabilities), M§5 (the profile message set),
//! M§6.5–M§6.6 (hub ordering, fan-out, group registration), M§9.1 (deposit once, push to bound
//! devices), M§14.2 (first-contact authorization).
//!
//! Impl: every decision comes from `dsip_messaging::{mailbox::Mailbox, hub::Hub}` and, for commits,
//! `dsip_mls::HubView`; this module only moves bytes and keeps the payloads the cursors name.
//! One instance serves the owner identities it is configured with ([`MailboxConfig::owners`]) and, with
//! [`MailboxConfig::serve_any`] N, up to N more that enrol by binding with a verified `hello` — how a `did:key` identity with no
//! document comes to have a mailbox (spec-gap 115); it hubs the groups whose deposits name it. A member whose
//! identity has no document is reached through its DHT reachability hint's `DSIPMailbox` endpoint (M§4.2), looked
//! up on the hints nodes in [`MailboxConfig::hints_nodes`]. An owner
//! device's deposit for a group hubbed elsewhere is forwarded unchanged to the hub registered for that
//! group, and the hub's answer comes back on the same path (M§5.2, spec-gap 45); the hub takes the
//! acting identity of a forwarded deposit from the delegation in its header, since the connection it
//! arrived on belongs to a mailbox. Welcomes a hub fans out carry the adder's deposit as `origin`,
//! which the receiving mailbox verifies (M§14.2, spec-gap 46).
//!
//! Impl (spec-gap 59): everything but live connections is saved to `<state>/mailbox.sqlite` after each change
//! (`crate::db`: each stored item a row, the rest in parts, only what changed written) and reloaded at startup — the
//! machines' full state, the hub's public MLS views, stored payloads and KeyPackages,
//! fan-out payloads still queued, hub references, revocations and the seen-id window. A restarted hub re-sends the
//! head of every unacknowledged fan-out queue at once, and after that any head left unacknowledged is re-sent with
//! backoff; a member mailbox acknowledges a redelivery as a duplicate.
