//! Introductions and grants delivered through the mailbox: verified as credentials, an introduction checked and its
//! sealed purpose opened, a grant kept for the `dsip.message` scope.
//!
//! Spec: M§14.1 (an introduction under the profile, `sealed` or `purpose` and never both; the purpose sealed to the
//! identity's key agreement key, M§6.9), core §19.4 (an introduction lives until its `expires_at`; a grant until its
//! `valid_until`), §7.4 (the signer bound to `from`), spec-gap 54 (they travel as mailbox deposits, held since they
//! were checked fresh), spec-gap 55 (the key agreement key derived from the identity key).
//!
//! Impl: a device that does not hold the identity key (a browser device linked without it) still keeps a checked
//! sealed introduction as a request, its purpose unread ([`Request::purpose`] is `None`); M§6.9 leaves which devices
//! hold the key to the identity.
