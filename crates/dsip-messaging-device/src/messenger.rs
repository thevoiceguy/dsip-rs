//! The messaging device, sans-I/O: this identity's device key under its delegation, its MLS groups and the state
//! the Messaging Profile asks a device to keep, driven with JSON strings and emitting frames and events. The host
//! moves frames between it and the mailbox and keeps the clock. The browser (`dsip-wasm`) and dsip-msg are its hosts,
//! their differences behind [`Config`].
//!
//! Spec: M§4.2 (the mailbox a `did:key` identity names in its reachability hint; the peer's found the same way),
//! M§4.3 (bind with a verified `hello`; the delegation carries `dsip.messaging`), M§5.2–M§5.5 (`deposit`,
//! `accepted`, `sync`/`items`, `key-packages`/`key-package-fetch`), M§6.2 (every leaf authenticated), M§6.4 (wire
//! forms), M§6.5 (a commit is applied only on the hub's `accepted`; refusals as the vector-pinned `CommitRetry`
//! decides, spec-gap 58; seq gaps held by `GapTracker`, spec-gap 69), M§6.6 (`mailbox-config` `joined`/`left`),
//! M§6.7 (KeyPackages uploaded), M§7.1 (the personal group and the first archive key), M§7.2 (a direct
//! conversation: the peer's devices and our own in one commit, hubbed at our mailbox, the held grant presented),
//! M§8.1 (content objects checked before rendering), M§8.5 (seq dedup and the ack cursor — `Resume`, spec-gap 44),
//! M§9.2–M§9.3 (pending until `accepted`; the same bytes re-deposited), M§10.2 (delivered receipts decided per sync
//! batch by the vector-pinned `Client`), M§12.1 (the archive key, kept for the device that will read history),
//! M§14.2 (a grant presented to the peer's mailbox), M§8.4 and M§5.6 (a blob sealed under a single-use key, uploaded
//! with a signed `blob-put`, named with its key in the content and without it in the manifest; fetched from the
//! sources the pinned rule orders and verified before it is opened), M§8.2 (`audio` content), M§10.4 (`played`, under
//! the same opt-in as `read`), M§13.2–M§13.3 (voicemail as caller-recorded audio carrying the session; a callee
//! leg's call event to the personal group, collapsed by session, interleaved into the peer's timeline), M§9.4 (a hub
//! that stops answering: content kept pending and retried by the pinned outbox, and past the device's threshold handed
//! to a successor), M§7.5 (the successor created at this identity's mailbox, re-adding the dead group's roster;
//! a successor welcome checked and converged on by the pinned tracker), M§12.1–M§12.3 (archive keys, archive records written for what
//! is shown and read back as history by a device added later, every live key re-sent to a new sibling), M§10.3 and
//! M§10.5 (a read watermark per conversation, disclosed only with the opt-in, else to the personal group).
//!
//! Impl: MLS state lives in the host's [`Store`]: in the browser OpenMLS's memory storage, exported with the delivery
//! state in one `save()` that the host writes as one record after each step — the atomic commit of spec-gap 44 in a
//! browser; natively a SQLite database, where each item's MLS writes and delivery state commit in one transaction and
//! the host writes [`Messenger::state`] after each step. A reload restores both. Pending deposits (not yet `accepted`) are kept with their bytes and re-deposited on the next bind (M§9.3:
//! idempotent at the hub by digest). Where the clients still differ, [`Config`] holds both behaviours.
