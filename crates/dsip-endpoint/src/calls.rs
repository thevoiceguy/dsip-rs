//! Call glue: what each host used to write around [`Core`] for an interactive call. [`Calls`] reads the SDP out of
//! offers and answers, buffers ICE candidates until they may be sent, gates media on the signed answer, answers by
//! policy, places a sealed call once more in clear when it is refused, and runs recording consent. It has no I/O: the
//! host keeps the media stack, does the media work [`Calls`] asks for ([`MediaRequest`]) and hands the results back
//! ([`MediaResult`]).
//!
//! Spec: §12.12 (candidates ride in signed `info`, ACTIVE-only), §14.1 (media starts on the signed answer), §14.4
//! (screening answers with a leg that sends nothing; escalation re-offers with the local source), §16.3 (SDP rides as
//! `transports[0].sdp`), §10.4 and §11.3 (a sealed body refused as an unknown critical extension: the sender MAY send
//! a new message in clear, once), C§3–C§4 (the other side's recording declaration is rendered, holds our media, or is
//! declined; a callee never answers before accepting it).
