//! `dsip-phone` — a phone: place calls, take them, hang up. What most calling applications hold.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # async fn demo() -> Result<(), dsip_phone::Error> {
//! use dsip_phone::{Outcome, Phone};
//!
//! let me = dsip_phone::Identity::load(std::path::Path::new("alice"))?;
//! let phone = Phone::builder().identity(me).relay("wss://relay.example:8443/dsip").build().await?;
//! let mut call = phone.call("did:key:z6Mk…").await?;
//! match call.outcome().await {
//!     Outcome::Answered { answered_by } => {
//!         println!("answered ({answered_by}): media is flowing");
//!         call.hang_up();
//!     }
//!     Outcome::Ended { reason } => println!("not reached: {reason}"),
//! }
//! # Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! A [`Phone`] runs its agent ([`dsip_transport::agent::Agent`]) and the media legs on a task of its own; the
//! application holds handles. [`Phone::call`] returns a [`Call`]; incoming calls arrive from [`Phone::incoming`] as
//! [`IncomingCall`]s to accept, screen or decline. Every protocol decision stays where it was: the endpoint core and
//! the call glue (`dsip_endpoint::calls`) choose what is sent, when media starts, and how a call answers by policy.
//!
//! Presence rides on the same task: [`Phone::set_presence`] publishes this device's state to its relay, and
//! [`Phone::watch`] follows another identity's, shown in [`Phone::presence`]. Watching needs a grant from that
//! identity with `dsip.subscribe` in its scope (P§6): one that came through the relay, or one held with
//! [`Phone::hold_grant`]; [`Phone::grant_request`] issues one.
//!
//! Spec: §12.4 (a call's states: placed, ringing, answered, ended), §12.11 (cancel before the answer, bye after),
//! §14.1 (media only after the signed answer, done by the call glue), §14.3 (`answered_by`), §14.4 (screening),
//! P§3–P§6 and §9.3 (presence), §19.4 (grants).
//!
//! Impl: a call's state is read from the endpoint's session after each step; the reason it ended is the `reason` of
//! the message that ended it, or the engine's `Ended` emission in that step, or `unknown`.
